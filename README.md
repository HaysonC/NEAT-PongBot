# A Study of Deep RL and NeuroEvolution in Atari Games

Note: DDQN and VPG are kinda bugging right now but hopefully they will get fixed sometime soon

## Usage

The runner script `run_agent.py` is also kinda retarded, but it will be fixed.

```
python run_agent.py --help
python run_agent.py --mode train --agent 3 --episodes 100
```

## Dependencies

Gym, Torch, Numpy, ALE-py (this is used for pong atari game)
